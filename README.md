A movie ticket booking platform was built by integrating React and Django. This application allows users to register, log in, and book movie tickets, 
with the ability to view their booking history. The user interface, developed with ReactJs, ensures an interactive booking experience. The Django admin 
interface empowers administrators and staff to manage movies, shows, and bookings efficiently.
